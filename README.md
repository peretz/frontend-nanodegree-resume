# Full Stack Foundations: Final Project - Restaurant and menu management system.

This project is based on Udacity's Javascript Basics final project. The objective
of this project is learning the key concepts around javaScript which includes:

* Using javaScript in HTML/CSS templates.
* DOM representation and its usage.
* Differences between bracket notation, dot notation and object literal notation.
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and it's validation.
* Concepts around data types: Truthy/Falsy, Arrays and objects (there are no classes).
* Scope in javaScript (there is no block scope) and flow control constructs (e.g. forEach)

In order to learn these concepts, the project implements my resume using HTML/CSS templates and using javaScript to dynamically load the info that I want.

## File Structure.

There are four files:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: Contains all the resume information as objects as well as the display logic.
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.

## Display the resume

1. Branch this repository to your machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser (e.g. file://your-local-path/index.html).
